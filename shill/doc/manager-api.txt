Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Return the global system properties specified
			in the Properties section.

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as read-write are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidProperty

		string GetState()

			Return the connection state of a system. The
			same value is return via the State property.

		object CreateProfile(string name)

			Create and add new profile with the specified
			identifier name.  The name should either be in the
			form ``name'' or ``~user/name'' where where ``user''
			is the login name of a user suitable for finding
			their home directory.  Both strings must contain
			only alpha-numeric ASCII characters.

			Profiles created without a user name are stored in
			a system directory readable only by the connection
			mananger.  Profiles created with a user name are
			stored in the user's home directory but readable
			only by the connection manager.

			If any existing profile is specified its contents
			are reset to a default (minimal) contents.  If the
			profile is already registered with a CreateProfile
			or PushProfile request then an error is returned.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.AlreadyExists

		object PushProfile(string name)

			Push the profile with the specified identifier
			onto the profile stack.  The profile must have
			previously been created with CreateProfile.
			The profile becomes the ``active profile'' that
			is searched first when loading data and to which
			updates are stored.

			A profile may be pushed only once.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.AlreadyExists

		object PopProfile(string name)

			Pop the top-most profile on the profile stack.
			Any profile beneath this profile becomes the
			``active profile''.  Any services using configuration
			from the popped profile are disconnected and the
                        credentials invalidated (the next time
			credentials are needed they are loaded from the
			(new) active profile).

			The name must match the identifer of the active
			profile.  This is a safeguard against accidentally
			removing the wrong profile.

			Note it is valid to pop all profiles from the
			stack; in this state the connection manager does
			not write any state to persistent storage.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotFound

		object PopAnyProfile()

			Like PopProfile but do not check the profile on
			the top of the stack; pop anything.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void RemoveProfile(string name)

			Remove the profile with specified identifier.

			The profile may not be resident on the stack.
			The default profile may not be removed.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.AlreadyExists

		void RequestScan(string type)

			Request a scan for the specified technology. If
			type is the string "" then a scan request is
			made for each technology.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void EnableTechnology(string type)

			Enable all technologies of the specified type.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.AlreadyEnabled

		void DisableTechnology(string type)

			Disable all technologies of the specified type.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.AlreadyDisabled

		void ConfigureService(dict properties)

			Update the configuration of a service in memory
			and in the profile.  If no service exists in
			memory it is temporarily created to carry out
			this work and then removed after saving its
			configuration to the profle.

			If a GUID property is specified in properties
			it is used to find the service; otherwise Type,
			Security, and type-specific properties such as
			WiFi.SSID are used to find any existing service.
			If no service is located in memory a new one is
			created with the supplied properties.

			All provided parameters are applied to the in
			memory service regardless of errors.  But if an
			error occurs while setting a property and the
			service object was created as a result of this
			call it is removed.  In the event of multiple
			errors the first error code is returned by
			this call.

			See the Service Properties section for a list of
			properties and constraints on property values.
			See also GetService.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotSupported

		object GetService(dict properties)

			Return the object path of a service after
			applying any requested configuration changes.
			If no service exists it is created.

			If a GUID property is specified in properties
			it is used to find the service; otherwise Type,
			Security, and type-specific properties such as
			WiFi.SSID are used to find any existing service.
			If no service is located in memory a new one is
			created with the supplied properties.

			All provided parameters are applied to the service
			regardless of errors.  But if an error occurs
			while setting a property and the service was
			created as a result of this call it is removed.
			In the event of multiple errors the first error
			code is returned by this call.

			See the Service Properties section for a list of
			properties and constraints on property values.
			See also ConfigureService.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotSupported
					 [service].Error.PermissionDenied
					 [service].Error.InternalError
					 [service].Error.InvalidNetworkName
					 [service].Error.InvalidPassphrase

		object GetVPNService(dict properties) --DEPRECATED--

			Like GetService, but only for "vpn" services and
			without using the GUID property to lookup a service.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotSupported
					 [service].Error.PermissionDenied
					 [service].Error.InternalError

		object GetWifiService(dict properties) --DEPRECATED--

			Like GetService, but only for "wifi" services and
			without using the GUID property to lookup a service.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotSupported
					 [service].Error.PermissionDenied
					 [service].Error.InternalError
					 [service].Error.InvalidNetworkName
					 [service].Error.InvalidPassphrase

		void SetDebugTags(string taglist)

			Set the debug tags that are enabled for logging to
			syslog. "taglist" is a list of valid tag names
			separated by "+".  Shill silently ignores
			invalid flags.

		string GetDebugTags()
			Get the list of enabled debug tags. The list is
			represented as a string of tag names separated
			by "+".

		string ListDebugTags()
			Get the list of all debug tags that can be enabled.
			The list is represented as a string of tag names
			separated by "+".

		string GetServiceOrder()

			Return a ','-separated string listing known technologies
			in priority ordering.

			For example, the default ordering would be returned as:
				"ethernet,bluetooth,wifi,wimax,cellular"

		void SetServiceOrder(string mask)

			Set the technology priority based on a provided
			','-separated list of technologies, sorted from highest
			priority to lowest.

			The list may contain the following services:
				{ ethernet, wifi, wimax, bluetooth, cellular }
			Technologies not included are assigned the lowest
			priority.

			Technology priority changes occur immediately.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void RecheckPortal()

			Retest the portal state of the active service
			if a check is not currently in progress.  This
			will only have an effect if the active service
			is currently in the portal state.


Signals		PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

		StateChanged(string state)

			This signal is similar to the PropertyChanged signal
			for the State property.

			It exists for application state only care about the
			current state and so can avoid to be woken up when
			other details changes.

Properties 	object ActiveProfile [readwrite]

			Object path of the current active profile.

		boolean ArpGateway [readwrite]

			Specifies whether the DHCP client should be
			configured to perform the extra step of performing
			an ARP of the gateway IP address.  This provides
			a level of assurance that the issued IP address is
			valid and not blocked in some manner unknown by the
			DHCP server.

		array{string} AvailableTechnologies [readonly]

			The list of available technologies. The strings
			are the same as the ones from the service types.

		string CheckPortalList [readwrite]

			The list of technologies for which captive portal
			checking is enabled.  This is a comma-separated
			string; e.g. "wifi,wimax,vpn".

		array{string} ConnectedTechnologies [readonly]

			The list of connected technologies. The strings
			are the same as the ones from the service type.

		string Country [readwrite]

			The ISO 3166 country code.  This may not be defined;
			it is defined if manually set or if it is discovered
			through a service such as WiFi, Celluar, or GPS.

		string DefaultTechnology [readonly]

			The current connected technology which holds the
			default route.

		array{object} Devices [readonly]

			List of device object paths.

		array{string} EnabledTechnologies [readonly]

			The list of enabled technologies. The strings
			are the same as the ones from the service types.

		string HostName [readwrite]

			The hostname to be reported in DHCP requests.
			Some DHCP servers may register a DNS entry on
			behalf of this hostname; others may just make
			available a table for administrators to tell
			what machines are on their network.

			The default for this name is empty, which
			means that the system will not report a hostname.

		string IgnoredDNSSearchPaths [readwrite]

			A comma-separated list of DNS domain suffixes
			which should be ignored when creating a DNS
			search list from DHCP-provided parameters.
			This list will be consulted every time DHCP
			information is updated (while connecting to
			a network, or when a DHCP lease is renewed).

		string LinkMonitorTechnologies [readwrite]

			The list of technologies for which thie Link
			Monitor will be enabled.  The Link monitor
			periodically checks for connectivity to the
			default gateway using ARP requests.

		boolean OfflineMode [readwrite]

			The offline mode indicates the global setting for
			switching all radios on or off. Changing offline mode
			to true results in powering down all devices. When
			leaving offline mode the individual policy of each
			device decides to switch the radio back on or not.

			During offline mode, it is still possible to switch
			certain technologies manually back on. For example
			the limited usage of WiFi or Bluetooth devices might
			be allowed in some situations.

		string PortalURL [readwrite]

			The URL to use when doing captive portal checking.
			When a service reaches the "ready" state and
			captive portal checking is enabled for it; an
			HTTP GET of this URL is done.  If this fails
			with a 204 error then the service is moved
			to the "online" state.  Otherwise the service
			is assumed to be not online and marked in a
			"portal" state.  Note that this check may fail
			for multiple reasons that are indicated in the
			Error property of the service.

		int32 PortalCheckInterval [readwrite]

			The interval in seconds between re-checking a
			service in the portal state.

		array{object} Profiles [readonly]

			List of profile object paths.

		array{object} Services [readonly]

			List of service object paths. The list is sorted
			internally to have the service with the default
			route always first and then the favorite services
			followed by scan results.

			This list represents the available services for the
			current selected profile. If the profile gets changed
			then this list will be updated.

			The same list is available via the profile object
			itself. It is just provided here for convenience of
			applications only dealing with the current active
			profile.

		array{object} ServiceWatchList [readonly]

			List of service object paths that are in a
			'non-idle' state.  This indicates the set of services
			which are currently listed as associating, configuring,
			or some other state other than idle.  This allows a
			caller to use this property indication to track which
			services should be monitored for state changes.

			In particular, services in error states like "failure"
			and "disconnect" are in the watchlist.

			The services are listed in the same service sorting
			order as the "Services" property above, but this
			property is not considered "changed" if the ordering
			changes.

			Changes to this list are batched up for small periods
			of time, so that batches of changes are collected
			into a single message containing the final state, and
			ephemeral changes where the list returns to the
			previous state are filtered out.

			Note: Currently shill reports the entire service
			list, unfiltered.

		string ShortDNSTimeoutTechnologies [readwrite]

			The list of technologies for which a short DNS
			timeout will be used, in order to improve retry
			performance.  This is a comma-separated string;
			e.g. "wifi,wimax,vpn".

		string State [readonly]

			The global connection state of a system. Possible
			values are "online" if at least one connection exists
			and "offline" if no device is connected.
