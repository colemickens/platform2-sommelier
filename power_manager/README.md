# Chrome OS Power Management

The Chrome OS power manager consists of several components:

-   `powerd`: C++ system daemon running as the `power` user that initiates
    dimming the screen, suspending the system, etc.
-   `powerd_setuid_helper`: setuid root binary used by powerd to perform actions
    requiring additional privileges.
-   `powerd_dbus_suspend`: shell script executed by powerd (by way of
    `powerd_setuid_helper`) to suspend and resume the system.
-   `send_metrics_on_resume`: shell script executed by `powerd_suspend` and by
    the `send-boot-metrics` Upstart job to report suspend-related metrics.

## Documentation

The [`docs/`](docs/) subdirectory contains additional documentation. Along with
answers to [frequently-asked questions](docs/faq.md), the following information
is available:

-   [Battery Notifications](docs/battery_notifications.md) describes when
    low-battery notifications are shown by the UI.
-   [Inactivity Delays](docs/inactivity_delays.md) describes powerd's logic for
    taking action (e.g. dimming the backlight or suspending) when the user is
    inactive.
-   [Input](docs/input.md) describes how powerd handles input events.
-   [Keyboard Backlight](docs/keyboard_backlight.md) describes powerd's logic
    for controlling the keyboard backlight.
-   [Logging](docs/logging.md) describes where and how powerd logs informative
    messages.
-   [Power Buttons](docs/power_buttons.md) describes how power buttons work.
-   [Screen Brightness](docs/screen_brightness.md) describes powerd's logic for
    controlling the display backlight.
-   [Suspend and Resume](docs/suspend_resume.md) describes powerd's process for
    suspending and resuming the system.
