  # Here (in order) are a list of the args added:
  # - Create and enter new UTS namespace (hostname/NIS domain name).
  # - Create and enter new network namespace.
  # - Create and enter new IPC namespace.
  # - Create and enter new cgroup namespace.
  # - Create and enter new PID namespace.
  # - Set mount namespace to be a slave mount.
  # - Set up a new VFS namespace (although this should be covered by
  #   minimalistic-mountns, leaving this out yields the following error:
  #   "Can't skip marking mounts as MS_PRIVATE without mount namespaces.")
  # - Use the minimal mountns profile to start.
  # - Get a writeable and empty /run tmpfs path.
  # - Mount dbus.
  # - Mount daemon store with the MS_BIND|MS_REC options to handle the case
  #   biod starts after the user's cryptohome is already mounted (e.g. after a
  #   crash).
  # - Get a writeable and empty /var tmpfs path.
  # - Mount the log directory in it.
  # - Mount the metrics directory.
  # - Mount the FPMCU dev node.
  # - Mount the /dev/uinput directory.
  # - Mount the /sys directory as chromeos-config tries to get the product name,
  #   sku and other details from sysfs files.
  # - Run as biod user and group.
  # - Inherit supplementary groups from from user biod.
  # - Grant no caps.
  # - No new privileges (no_new_privs).
  # - Use biod seccomp policy.
  # - Execute the daemon.
  # - Add the log dir.
  # - Pipe output to biod.out.
