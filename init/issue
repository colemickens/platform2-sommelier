Developer Console

To return to the browser, press:

  [ Ctrl ] and [ Alt ] and [ <- ]  (F1)

To use this console, the developer mode switch must be engaged.
Doing so will destroy any saved data on the system.

In developer mode, it is possible to
- login and sudo as user 'chronos'
- require a password for sudo and login(*)
- disable power management behavior (screen dimming):
  sudo initctl stop powerd
- install your own operating system image!

* To set a password for 'chronos', run the following as root:

chromeos-setdevpasswd

If you are having trouble booting a self-signed kernel, you may need to
install the developer firmware.  To do so, run the following as root:

chromeos-firmwareupdate --mode=todev

Have fun and send patches!
