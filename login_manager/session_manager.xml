      brokering certain privileged operations on the browser's behalf.

        Restarts the browser, leaving it open for testing automation.
        Adds an argument to the chrome child job command line that causes it,

        Similar to StorePolicy() above, but for user policy.
        @policy_blob should contain a serialized PolicyFetchResponse protobuf
        which wraps the actual policy data along with an SHA1-RSA signature
        over the policy data. The policy data is opaque to session_manager,
        the exact definition is only relevant to client code in Chrome.

        Calling this function attempts to persist the policy blob for
        a given user. Policy is stored in a root-owned location
        within the user's cryptohome (for privacy reasons). The
        first attempt to store policy also installs the signing
        key for user policy. This key is used later to verify policy
        updates pushed by Chrome.
