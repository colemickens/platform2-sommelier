# Libvda Rust wrapper

Rust wrapper for libvda. This library is used to enable communication with
Chrome's GPU process to perform hardware accelerated decoding and encoding.
It is currently in development to be used by crosvm's virtio-video device.

## Building for a CrOS board

You can build and run unittests with emerge in chroot.

```shell
# Build
(chroot)$ emerge-{BOARD} dev-rust/libvda
# Unit tests
(chroot)$ FEATURES=test emerge-{BOARD} dev-rust/libvda
```

### Building for the host environment

You can also execute `cargo` directly for faster build and tests. This would be
useful when you are developing this crate.
Since this crate depends on libvda.so, you need to install it to host
environment first.

```shell
# Change host's linker to gold since host environment's default linker GNU ld
# fails to link libraries.
(chroot)$ sudo binutils-config --linker ld.gold
(chroot)$ sudo emerge chromeos-base/libvda        # Install libvda.so to host.
# Build
(chroot)$ cargo build
# Unit tests
(chroot)$ cargo test
```

## Updating generated bindings

`src/common_bindings.rs` is automatically generated from `libvda_common.h`.
`src/decode_bindings.rs` is automatically generated from `libvda_decode.h`.
`src/encode_bindings.rs` is automatically generated from `libvda_encode.h`.

See the header of the bindings file for the generation command.
