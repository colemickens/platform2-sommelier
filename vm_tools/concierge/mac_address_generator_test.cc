// to reduce the number of addresses we need to generate.  We know that the 2
// least significant bits of the first octet in the address are fixed.  This
// leaves 2^46 possible addresses.  Generating 2^25 addresses gives us a 99.96%
// chance of triggering a collision in this range.  So if the generator returns
// 2^25 unique addresses then we can be fairly certain that it won't give out
// duplicate addresses.
// This test is currently disabled because it takes a long time to run
// (~minutes).  We ran it on the CQ for several months without issue so we can
// be pretty confident that the current implementation does not produce
// duplicates.  If you make any changes to the mac address generation code,
