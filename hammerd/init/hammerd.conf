description   "Hammer firmware updater task"

# When the hammer device is plugged, udev emits hammer-device-added signal.
# The example rule file: hammerd/udev/99-hammerd.rules.example
# Additionally, start hammerd when ash gets initialized. Ash observes
# signals from hammerd and, if needed, notifies the user of connected hammer
# state. This means that hammerd should be rerun to ensure ash has received
# relavant signals, in case ash missed signals emitted when hammer device was
# added (e.g. if ash had restarted after hammer device addition due to user
# session restart).
# NOTE: ash-initialized signal is emitted by session manager on request from
# the browser process once ash initialization completes.

# applications to use. Store sysfs path file in a separate directory
