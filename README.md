# The Chromium OS Platform

This repo holds (most) of the custom code that makes up the Chromium OS
platform.  That largely covers daemons, programs, and libraries that were
written specifically for Chromium OS.

We moved from multiple separate repos in platform/ to a single repo in
platform2/ for a number of reasons:

* Make it easier to work across multiple projects simultaneously
* Increase code re-use (via common libs) rather than duplicate utility
  functions multiple items over
* Share the same build system

While most projects were merged, not all of them were.  Some projects were
standalone already (such as vboot), or never got around to being folded in
(such as imageloader).  Some day those extra projects might get merged in.

Similarly, some projects that were merged in, were then merged back out.
This was due to the evolution of the Brillo project and collaboration with
Android.  That means the AOSP repos are the upstream and Chromium OS carries
copies.
