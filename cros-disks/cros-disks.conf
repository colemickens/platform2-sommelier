# Run cros-disks under Minijail as follows:
# - Enter new IPC (-l) namespace.
#
# - Remain in the original network namespace in order to join to the system
#   DBus.
#
# - Remain in the original cgroup namespace as it isn't supported on systems
#   running kernel 3.8. TODO(benchan): Put cros-disks in new cgroup namespace
#   once all systems support it.
#
# - Temporarily skip new mount (-v) and PID (-p) namespace as cros-disks
#   needs to access /home/user/<hash> for archive support, which isn't
#   accessible inside a new mount namespace. TODO(benchan): Put cros-disks in
#   new mount and PID namespace after archive support in cros-disks is
#   deprecated (chromium:707327).
#
# - To let upstart track the cros-disks process properly according to the
#   'expect fork' stanza, Minijail exits immediately after fork (-i) while
#   cros-disks stays in foreground (--foreground) without daemonizing itself.
#
# - Use -K to prevent Minijail from remounting the shared mount at /media as
#   private.
#   TODO(benchan): Remove -K once Minijail provides a finer control over
#   what should be remounted private and what can remain shared (b:62056108).
#
# - Do not lock SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS (-B 0x20) such that nested minijail invocations
#   can enable the bit again to pass capabilities.
